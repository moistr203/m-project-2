## Description
This submission contains my implementation of a calculator project that performs arithmetic operations on fractions.

## Resources Used
- **Tutors**: I consulted with my tutor to clarify the implementation of fraction operations, which helped me understand how to manage arithmetic using `BigInteger`.
- **Fellow Students**: Collaborating with classmates allowed me to share ideas and troubleshoot issues related to the project structure and functionality.
- **StackOverflow**: I used StackOverflow to find solutions for handling exceptions in Java, which enhanced the error handling in my code.
